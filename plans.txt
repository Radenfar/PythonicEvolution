NEURON -> ADJ LIST:
creatures are going to be represented by an adjacency list of neurons
Essentially, index i of the list is a neuron, and the value at index i is a list of neurons that it is connected to

CREATURES:
Three layers of network: input (sensory nodes), internal and output (motor nodes).
Creatures are born with a set of input neurons that produce a floating point value between 0 and 1.
This then multiplied by some small floating point number in a small range between (-4, 4) and then passed to the internal layer.
Each of the internal neurons will sum up each of the incoming connections and it will take that sum, positive or negative, and run it through a hyperbolic tangent function to produce a number between -1 and 1.
Each of the output neurons will, likewise, sum up each of the incoming connections and run it through a hyperbolic tangent function to produce a number between -1 and 1 and this will determine whether this action neuron will fire or not.
For example, if the output neuron (after the hyperbolic tangent function) is > 0, then the floating point number will be interpreted as a probability of it firing.

INTERNAL LAYER:
Also an adjacency list. 
At each adj[i] is a list [0-26] of sensory inputs connected and a list [0-8] of motor outputs connected.

SENSORY INPUTS (* if need to be queried from environment)
0: Fat = food at location *
1: Fdf = food density forward * 
2: Fdr = food density right *
3: Fdl = food density left *
4: Fdb = food density backward *
5: Age = age 
6: Rnd = random input
7: Ene = energy/fitness
8: Clf = creature left *
9: Clr = creature right *
10: Cfd = creature forward * 
11: Cbd = creature backward *
12: Plf = population density left *
13: Prt = population density right *
14: Pfd = population density forward *
15: Pbd = population density backward *
16: LMy = last movement Y
17: LMx = last movement X
18: BDy = north/south border distance *
19: BDx = east/west border distance *
20: BD = nearest border distance *
21: GNF = genetic similarity of fwd neighbor * (query environment for agent object, query self for comparison with other agent as param)
22: GNB = genetic similarity of bwd neighbor *
23: GNL = genetic similarity of left neighbor *
24: GNR = genetic similarity of right neighbor *
25: INW = input weight (input * INW = internal layer -> between -4 and 4)
26: OTW = output weight (internal * OTW = output layer -> between -4 and 4)

ACTION OUTPUTS
0: Eat = Consume at location (if food is present)
1: Rpd = Attempt to reproduce with fwd neighbour
2: Kill = kill fwd neighbor
3: Mfd = move forward
4: Mrn move random
5: Mrv = move reverse
6: MRL = move left/right (+/-)
7: MX = move east/west (+/-)
8: MY = move north/south (+/-)

RESTRICTIONS FOR REPRODUCTION:
- fitness >= 3
- genetic similarity > 0.8
- age > 10
